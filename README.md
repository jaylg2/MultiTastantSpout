# MultiTastantSpout
This directory contains open source design materials for a rodent behavioral environment for learning from positive and negative events. These materials are for an Arduino controlled lick spout that controls delivery of small amounts of three different tastants, playing of 2 different tones (11KHz and 4KHz in this design), and timing of an in-cage light cue. 

See MultiTast_Overview for information on the build
